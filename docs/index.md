# Vetting Process

 - Initial phone screen for basic core feature questions. Check for
    - Aptitude
    - Communications
 - Notify Infosys about the candidate.   
 - Coding phase
    - Provide a JSON object and ask candidate to transform it. 
    - Provide a more comprehensive project and view the candidate's skills
 - Submit to Infosys      
 
We are currently working on automating the process so that the __initial phone screen__ for tech can
be delivered online and the __coding phase__ can be performed on our online test platform via [v8tted.com](https://v8tted.com).
Intent is to provide: 
 - Recording of the candidate's session
 - Automated test score
 - Assessor feedback 
 
Till the platform comes live, we will provide the same using manual assessments.
